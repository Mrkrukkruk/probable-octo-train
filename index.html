          <h2>Cebu</h2>
          <p>
            If you like jumping into or swimming in cool cascading waters, Kawasan Falls in Cebu hits the sweet spot. It
            is a multi-layered waterfall in the town of Badian, and is best known for its turquoise waters.
            With a height of 40 meters, the first cascade, or level, is where most visitors stay, swim, and enjoy a
            natural water massage on board a bamboo raft. A 10-minute trek takes you up to the quieter second cascade.
            Kawasan Falls is also the endpoint of the popular adventure activity, the canyoneering adventure. This tour
            starts in Kanlaob River in the town of Alegria, where you make your way to Kawasan, swimming along streams,
            rappelling through natural rock walls, and finally jumping off mini-waterfalls.
            Nearby is the town of Moalboal, famous for its sardine run experience, where you swim with millions of
            sardines just offshore.

          <h2>Coron</h2>
          <p>
            Undoubtedly one of the most photographed and iconic destinations in the Philippines is Kayangan Lake in
            Coron, Palawan. Its lagoon is a dreamy mix of blues and greens glistening on a bright, sunny day.
            Kayangan Lake tours will take you to the jagged limestone cliffs and islets surrounding the lake. All these
            add up to a dramatic landscape, best seen from a 10-minute climb up a hill. Curiously, this view is not of
            the actual Kayangan Lake but the area where the tour boats park, but it is still breathtaking nonetheless.
            As spectacular as the views are above ground, the real gem is hidden underneath the lake’s glass-like
            waters. Rock formations and schools of fish abound, making the area a favorite snorkeling and free-diving
            spot for visitors.
            The island destinations is also famous for island-hopping excursions and diving in its numerous shipwreck
            sites, among many other must-try Coron adventures.

          <h2>Manila</h2>
          <p>
            Many travelers skip Manila and make their way to the Philippines' other islands but a day or two in the
            country’s capital to go on Manila tours is still highly recommended.
            The hustle and bustle aside, Manila features a lot of tourist spots of historical importance. One of which
            is the Rizal Park, or more commonly known as Luneta.
            This 60-hectare urban park is where you will see the Rizal Monument, marking the execution site of the
            country’s national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal. Manila Bay’s breeze keeps the Philippine flag waving from a
            46-meter flagpole fronting his monument.
            The park also features manicured gardens, ponds, and a wide water fountain that lights up and dances to
            Filipino tunes by sunset. The park area is also home to a network of National Museums that you can visit.

        <h2>Palawan</h2>
        <p>
          Tubbataha Reef is regarded as one of the top diving spots in the Philippines, and perhaps, the world. Located
          at the heart of the Sulu Sea, it is considered a center of marine biodiversity and a haven not just for divers
          but marine conservationists as well. The only way to get to this marine sanctuary is through a liveaboard
          vessel from Puerto Princesa, Palawan.
          The access may be challenging, but it is probably what is keeping the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park teeming
          with some of the most unique underwater life in the world. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and
          was nominated as part of the “New Seven Wonders of the Natural World.”
          Among the species that call Tubbataha home include reef sharks, manta rays, Napoleon wrasses, and more than
          half of all the world's coral species. One of its islets is also a breeding site for birds and marine turtles.
          Visits to the natural park require months or even years of planning, but experiencing the staggering wealth
          underneath is more than worth it.

        <h2>Siargao</h2>
        <p>
          Siargao’s rise as a top tourist spot in the Philippines is nothing short of meteoric. Once a sleepy island in
          Surigao del Norte, it has become one of the favorite destinations and playgrounds for travelers, and it is
          primarily because of one activity: surfing.
          It is now known as the Philippines' surfing capital, and some even regard it as the surfing mecca of Asia.
          Surfers are drawn to Cloud 9, the most famous surfing spot in the entire country. From November until April,
          all is well with Cloud 9’s thick tubes, making it a perfect place to get stoked (note: it is recommended for
          advanced surfers only).
          But you do not need to be riding the waves to enjoy this island destination as there are also other fun
          Siargao activities and beautiful attractions to visit like rock pools, waterfalls, and the nearby Sohoton
          Lagoon, where you can swim with thousands of non-sting jellyfish.
          Find other Siargao experiences that you can add to your travel plans.

        <h2>Tagaytay</h2>
        <p>
          Locals and foreign visitors from Manila often take a quick escape from the megacity and make their way down
          south to Tagaytay, a relaxing town famous for its cool weather and magnificent views.
          The best views face Taal Volcano, the world’s smallest active volcano. The volcano sits on an island within a
          lake within an island. If that is not interesting enough, you can actually hike up to the volcano crater with
          excursions to Taal Volcano.
          An outrigger boat first takes you on a 15-minute ride to Volcano Island, and from there, you can do a
          35-minute hike or ride horseback all the way to the main crater.
          While in Tagaytay and Batangas, heat up your trip with a delectable bowl of Bulalo, a clear broth with beef
          shanks, bone marrow, and corn swimming in all its savory glory.
